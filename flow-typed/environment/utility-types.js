/**
 * Flow allows optional properties ({foo?: number}) to be present and set to
 * undefined, but does not distinguish that case from an omitted prop.
 *
 * In particular, when a var with type {foo?: number} is spread over a
 * {foo: number}, the resulting type is {foo: number}, even though
 * {...{foo: 42}, ...{foo: undefined}} is {foo: undefined} at runtime,
 *
 * This utility turns {foo?: number} into {foo?: void | number}, which
 * can be safely spread, forcing handling of potentially present but undefined
 * props.
